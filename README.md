# Sorting Visualizer

This project was meant to teach me how the different sorted algorithms work, and for me visualizing works the best. 

  

To run the file, simply pass the name of the sorting algorithm while running the file

>python visualizer.py [arg]

  

Different args are:

* bubble-sort

* merge-sort

* quick-sort
